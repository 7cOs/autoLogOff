# AutoSignOut

## Description
Sign out of Windows OS automatically

## Purpose
Expedites Windows OS sign out by implementing that process via a simple icon (.jar (exe) file) stored on the user's desktop. 
User simply double-clicks the icon to sign out of Windows - obviating the need to preess ctrl-alt-del or other manual measures to acheive that purpose. 

## Future
Considers activating auto-sign out via recognised voice control or facial recognition and mental telepathy solutions.
