# AutoSignOut

## Description
Sign out of Windows OS automatically

## Purpose
Expedites Windows OS sign out by implementing that process via a simple icon (.jar (exe) file) stored on the user's desktop. 
User simply double-clicks the icon to sign out of Windows -- obviating the need to press ctrl-alt-del buttons or other manual measures to acheive that purpose. 

## Future
Future iterations will consider the following solutions for auto sign-out activation.
